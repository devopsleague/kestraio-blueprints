  description: >-
    This workflow will only run `step2` if the input `run_everything`
    is set to `true`. This allows you to build a workflow where you 
    can decide to run all of it or specific parts based on inputs.

    It also uses a schedule that sets the input to `true`. This is a good
    way to have the schedule run different parts of the workflow, or have 
    a debug mode that you only use when executing the flow manually.
